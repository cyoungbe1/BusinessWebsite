    <h3>About Us</h3>
    <p>


  Our Dog Retreat programs include loads of indoor and outdoor play, grooming services and field trips with just the right amount of resting in between. Large dogs play in the outdoor area, and we have separate playrooms for small dogs and big dogs to ensure compatibility by size. We provide a climate-controlled daycare and overnight-care that is a healthy alternative to leaving your dog at home all day or when you're out of town. <br></br>

  All guests take frequent naps/quiet breaks throughout the day to decompress from playtime. We strive to maintain a safe and healthy dog retreat environment for your pup by guaranteeing supervised playgroups. Our loving staff is trained to understand the complexities of dog interactions and the dynamics of the dog pack mentality. <br></br> The benefits of enrolling your dog in our program are unlimited, starting from continual exercise and socialization, to increased confidence that teaches dogs proper canine manners.

  We take the safety of the pets in our care very seriously, so each dog must first complete a Free Meet & Greet to ensure that they are a good fit for pet retreat care.

  Book your dog's Meet & Greet today for a FREE trial one-night/one-day stay!

  We provide webcam access to all of our clients so that they can check in on their happy pets. <br></br> For any additional questions or concerns feel free to call us at (555) 555-5555.
